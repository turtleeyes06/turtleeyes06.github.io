This directory contains Nick Carroll's submission for
CSE 5542 Spring 2017 lab4.

** Describes how to use your program

To use, open the lab04.html. The control of different objects is changed
by html button and each object can be rotated on a given axis, also changed
by html button, using the mouse. Each object can also be moved around the screen
according to their local coordinates with the following commands:
  f - forward
  b - backwards
  u - up
  d - down
  l - left
  r - right

p and q will rotate the camera around its z axis. The camera's 'look at' can also
be altered by html buttons.

The hierarchy for this object is the following:

body - cab
body - front wheel
body - back wheel
body - pole - pole top

** States which bonus tasks you attempted
  I only attempted to create an interesting object. I chose to use the wire
  frame for the body as it allowed for more visibility of the other objects.

** Lists which browser/OS you developed your code on (just in case)
  I developed this code using Microsoft windows 10 and the Firefox browser
